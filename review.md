# Markdown File for Matt's Code (Average Calculator)

By: Kaihil Patel

## This is the code...



```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class personA {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		System.out.println("Please type in two integers for the average");
		Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
		int first = scan.nextInt();
		int second = scan.nextInt();
		double avg = (first + second) / 2.0;
		System.out.println("The average is " + avg);
	}

}

```

## ummmmmmmmmm Average Calculator
matt's code takes in 2 integers and it calculates the average and prints it out.
the user has to give 2 numbers, then the code adds them together and divides by 2 , getting the average
then it prints it so the user can see
